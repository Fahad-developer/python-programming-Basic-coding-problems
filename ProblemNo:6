#Problem:
"""
 Make a list of your favorite fruits, and then write a series of 
independent if statements that check for certain fruits in your list.
•	 Make a list of your three favorite fruits and call it favorite_fruits.
•	 Write five if statements. Each should check whether a certain kind of fruit 
is in your list. If the fruit is in your list, the if block should print a statement, 
such as You really like bananas!
